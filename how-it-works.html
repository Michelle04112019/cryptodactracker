        <h2>DAC Strategy for Long-Term Investment</h2>
        <p>
            The DAC strategy is a simple but effective approach to investing in cryptocurrencies over the long term. It relies on three key principles:
        </p>
        <ul style="margin: 1rem 0;">
            <li><strong>Diversification:</strong> Invest in multiple cryptocurrencies to reduce risk.</li>
            <li><strong>Accumulation:</strong> Buy regularly to benefit from cost averaging and take advantage of compounding effects.</li>
            <li><strong>Conviction:</strong> Choose strong projects that you believe in for the long term.</li>
        </ul>
