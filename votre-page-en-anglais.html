        <h2>DAC Strategy for Long-Term Investment</h2>
        <p>
            The DAC strategy is a simple yet effective approach for investing in cryptocurrencies over the long term. It is based on three key principles:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Diversification:</strong> Invest in several cryptocurrencies to reduce risks.</li>
            <li><strong>Accumulation:</strong> Regularly purchase to benefit from dollar-cost averaging and capitalize on compounding effects.</li>
            <li><strong>Conviction:</strong> Choose solid projects that you believe in for the long term.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Track Your Portfolio?</h2>
        <p>
            With Crypto DAC Tracker, you can track the main cryptocurrencies in real time according to the DAC strategy. Each cryptocurrency is tracked on several criteria. Here are the main indicators you'll find on the cryptocurrency cards:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>24-Hour Change:</strong>
                <p>
                    This indicator shows the price change of a cryptocurrency over the last 24 hours. It can help you evaluate short-term trends and market volatility. A positive change indicates an increase, while a negative change signals a decrease.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Trust Index:</strong>
                <p>
                    The trust index is a measure of a cryptocurrency's stability and potential. It is calculated by considering several technical and fundamental factors, such as price history, liquidity, network security, and the project's reputation. A high index indicates a cryptocurrency that presents stability and better resilience against market fluctuations.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Advice:</strong>
                <p>
                    A simple investment advice is provided for each cryptocurrency (Buy, Hold, Sell). This advice is based on the DAC strategy, considering long-term trends and market evolution. It helps you make informed decisions based on the current market conditions.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Transaction Volume:</strong>
                <p>
                    Transaction volume indicates the activity on the cryptocurrency market over the last 24 hours. A high volume suggests strong activity and sustained interest in the cryptocurrency, which may indicate its popularity and liquidity.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Market Capitalization:</strong>
                <p>
                    Market capitalization is a key indicator of a cryptocurrency's size. It is calculated by multiplying the current price by the total supply in circulation. A high market cap may indicate a solid project, but it is also important to consider other factors to avoid relying solely on this indicator.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>RSI (Relative Strength Index):</strong>
                <p>
                    The RSI indicator is used to measure the speed and variations of a cryptocurrency's price. It ranges from 0 to 100 and helps identify overbought (RSI > 70) or oversold (RSI < 30) conditions. This helps investors spot buying or selling opportunities based on market conditions.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence):</strong>
                <p>
                    The MACD is a technical indicator used to track market trends. It measures the difference between two exponential moving averages (EMAs) and can signal good moments to buy or sell based on the convergence or divergence of these averages.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
